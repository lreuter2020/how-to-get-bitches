        <h2>How To Get Bitches</h2>
        <p>
            Many people have been walking around bitchless lately, what has caused this recent uptrend in bitchlessness?
            Some people think it has to do with a decline in male attractiveness but it is infact due to tardiness. People
            who arrive early tend to be the last to get bitches, it seems the early bird does not get the worm (in this case
            the worm is a bitch). Being tardy actually raises the chances of getting bitches as seen in this UC Davis study by
            Julie Nguyen, where it was found that "I've been late many times and I have an excess of bitches." <a href="#cite">[1]</a>
